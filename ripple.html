          The core of this project was to explore what it means to run a
          company from a day-to-day perspective, including: management,
          organisation, culture, finance and clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team started off with a workshop to come up with the company’s
          core values, vision and mission.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
          To create an effective team collaboration, both self-organising and
          cross-functional, to lead a productive process and evaluate our
          development, I introduced our team to the Scrum framework.
        </p>

        <p>
          The framework is based on continuous learning and constant
          improvements throughout the process. It’s structured by an
          overarching vision, our briefs and debriefs, with a dynamic product
          backlog enabling changes and adjustments. We divided the project into
          several sprints with their own backlog. During the sprints we had
          daily stand up meetings which included the team members going through
          what one did the day before, what one will do today and if there are
          any obstacles to get it done. At the end of the sprint we took time
          for review, going through goals, and retrospective, assessing the
          goals.

          The digital tool Notion was used as a workspace to structure the
          project: write our backlogs, plan our sprints and schedule team
          meetings.

        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>
          I created the brand identity and the visual design, which included
          the logo, colors and fonts. My skeleton to start visualising the body
          of company based on our team’s core values, vision and mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          I, together with the copywriter in our team, came up with the name of
          the studio: Studio Ripple, on the notion that a single action can
          create an impact of ripples.

        <h2>The Logo</h2>
        <p>
          The logo represents the ripple effect in motion. I wanted this to be
          reflected in name as well, so I created a font with a smooth
          movement. The ripple effect of something being dropped in water was
          my outset for deciding the color palette. The colours represent
          different shades of the sea and the accent colours are shades of the
          sunset reflected in the water.

        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>
          A design studio with a brandbook, business concept and working
          methods. Our studio worked with two clients with one brief each.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was successful? That transparency and close communication with
          the client is key to nail the brief. Also, the importance of
          constructive feedback, appreciate each other’s work and celebrate
          throughout the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          What could’ve been done differently? I’d want to create and present a
          simplified logo that could be cut from paper.

      Curious to know how Word Art sparked my joy for design? Interested in
      discussing how to transform ideas into visuals? I’d be more than happy
      to hear from you. Drop me a line.
