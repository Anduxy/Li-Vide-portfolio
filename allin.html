        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          All In Foundation is a social impact tech start up and digital non-
          profit foundation developing a new way of fundraising to fight
          extreme poverty. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The overarching objective in the brief was to deliver a top-class app
          that is easy to use and that attracts a high number of recurrent
          users. More specifically, the project has succeeded if it receives
          positive feedback from test users.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
          To explore the objective of the brief and to structure our creative
          process and improve our way of working to come up with a solution,
          we chose the design process model Double Diamond. We started with
          understanding the why and defining the how, explored the possible
          solutions, created one and tested it.

        <h2>Gathering Insights</h2>
        <p>
          One main motivation behind donating is the social aspect. The social
          aspect can be that the donation matters to someone or something they
          know and care about, to feel good about oneself or looking good to
          others and by being influenced by friends and family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on research on the target group, understanding the motivation
          on donation combined with social media, it became clear that
          community, personalisation and gamification were three cornerstones
          to build a concept around.

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>
          After gathering insights we moved on to using different methods and
          tools to come up with ideas, ideas and again ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          To decide on ideas to further develop we used a 2x2 decision matrix
          with the factors feasibility and engagement. The ideas with the
          highest result on the axis were chosen to develop further.

          Me and my team came up with a plan presented in three phases:
          minimal viable product, near future and dream within the timeframe of
          tomorrow, in the coming months and in a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each phase with features from the ideation phase to add in the app.

        <p>
          To get a better understanding of the target audience, with the
          purpose of acquisition, I explored motivations, needs, hesitations
          and what can be gained for different individuals to use the app. By
          creating different user personas and user stories I could identify
          user pain points and come up with features in the app to try to
          solve those.

          I created the concept and visualisation of the dream phase to be
          implemented in a year. The main focus is on community, tapping into
          the social aspect, and gamification, utilising the positive effects
          of game elements, with two respective features. Both with the
          intention to help each other to fight extreme poverty. Giving the
          user the ability to:

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>
          I conducted user testing with several prototypes, both low fidelity
          versions as well as digital, throughout the process. Observing the
          user’s interactions with the prototypes gave valuable insight on
          users understanding and expectations, functionality of the product
          and actual user flows.

        <p>
          It was my intention to find out what was important to the user, what
          would give them the confidence to continue and what barriers that
          would make the user quit their interaction in the app. My overall
          goal was to figure out how to offer an experience as positive and
          smooth as possible.

          What was successful? The client appreciated our work and could see
          the concept be implemented with some tweaks in the design and phases.
          The teamwork worked great due to our trust in each other. Frequent
          communication and giving support throughout the process made it
          possible for creative and diligent flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          What could’ve been done differently? If I had focused more on the
          MVP, I would have been able to deliver a ready-to-code concept to
          the client. As a team I think we could have streamlined our design
          over the phases to correlate better with each other.

      Curious to know how Word Art sparked my joy for design? Interested in
      discussing how to transform ideas into visuals? I’d be more than happy
      to hear from you. Drop me a line.
