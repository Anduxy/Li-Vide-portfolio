        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Hope is a Swedish fashion brand with a passion for high-quality
          garments that inspire and emphasize the individual style. The brand
          believes in progressive &ndash; yet timeless &ndash; design,
          strong tailoring and attention to detail. They’re passionate about
          diversity, creativity and self-expression. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The brief was to develop the brand using data-driven strategy with
          Hope’s values at its core.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
          To explore the objective of the brief and to structure our creative
          process and improve our way of working to come up with a solution,
          we chose the design process model Double Diamond. We started with
          understanding the why and defining the how, explored the possible
          solutions, created one and tested it.

        <h2>Gathering Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Based on a combination of several sources of quantitative data the
          service is especially attractive to the age range of 18-30-year-olds.
          A target group that to some level already has an active engagement
          with the brand, but with other values and financial position compared
          to the average Hope customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Catering to Hope’s value for a more sustainable fashion consumption,
          the solution is built with a circular economy as the core to reduce
          waste and have continual use of resources.

        <h2>Understanding the Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          With our insights, we could start defining the challenges. To turn
          those challenges into opportunities we came up with the following
          “How Might We” questions:
        </p>
        <ul class="side-margins">
          <li>
            How might we create a new business model for Hope to collect and
            use customer data in a more systematic way?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we align with upcoming trends, without compromising the
            brand identity?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we widen the audience of Hope without lowering the price
            hence damaging the brand equity compromising the quality?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we maximize the design effort and fully value the
            creative process for Image Styles garments?

        <h2>Conceptualising</h2>
        <p>
          From our questions, we started the developing phase by ideating.
        </p>
        <p>
          I came up with the idea of renting a Hope piece. Together with my
          team, we developed this idea into a subscription service. The customer
          rents a couple of Hope pieces for a limited time, able to
          return the items and switch to other pieces for a new period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Introducing this rotation of items will provide more use out of each
          garment while aiming to fulfil the need to change the style and try new
          garments without choosing fast fashion.

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          To evaluate our ideas we selected factors such as data collection
          opportunity, adaptable to the future, gender creative and feasibility
          amongst others. The variables were rated from a scale 1-3 and the
          factors with the highest score were decided to develop further.

        <h2>Develop</h2>
        <p>
          To understand the potential experience from the user’s standpoint I
          wanted to dig deeper into the present shopping experience. I
          visualised a map focusing on the particular interaction of buying a
          Hope piece as it is today. Parallel to this, I visualised the future
          user journey with the new concept. Below is a streamlined version of
          the user journeys.

        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          I created a high-fidelity prototype to get at better comprehension of
          the service visually. It also allowes testing and making improvements simultaneously with developing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To improve the user experience a feature of adding items to a
          wishlist was implemented, making it easier for the user to order the
          items later on. This feature also enables collecting data on what
          the user likes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The look of the app is having the overall design similar to the one
          on Hope’s website, to make the transition from the current experience
          to the new concept easy. The prototype includes:

        <p>
          A subscription service built with wireframes for an app.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was successful? The client was thrilled by the concept and
          wanted to keep in contact to explore how this could turn into
          reality. Also, the rigorous research, analysing the data and finding
          patterns to come up with a solution viable for a new target group.
        </p>
        <p>
          What could’ve been done differently? I think allocating resources
          from the discover and define phase to do thorough user testing. To
          test our assumptions we based our solution on. Implement more of a
          learn by doing mindset to get a better user insight and to improve
          the service.

      discussing how to transform ideas into visuals? I’d be more than happy
